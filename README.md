  <h2>Welcome to the Image Processing Repository!</h2>
  <p>
    This repository utilizes the power of OpenCV to perform a basic and intermediate  program of image processing and some project.
  </p>
  
   <h2>Tools Use:</h2>
  <p>
    1)Python
    2)OpenCv
    3)matplotlib
    </p>
  
  <h2>Usage Guide:</h2>
